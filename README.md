This project is my personal portfolio website. I designed the layout of my website first on Figma, then 
started coding each component in VSCode using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I learned from the OdinProject.
Although the website may seem simple, I am constantly trying to improve my programming skills and learn more. 
I hope that my website will continue to be enhanced in the future.
